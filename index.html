      <h1>Understanding Earth’s Layers</h1>
      <p>Earth is made up of distinct layers that each play a crucial role in supporting life, shaping landscapes, and creating the magnetic field that protects us. Explore each layer to learn more about our planet's fascinating inner structure.</p>

  <section id="crust" class="layer-section">
    <h1>Crust</h1>
    <p>The Earth's crust is the outermost layer, composed of solid rock, minerals, and soil. It’s divided into two types: continental and oceanic crust.</p>
    <p><strong>Did you know?</strong> The crust makes up less than 1% of Earth’s volume but is essential for supporting life!</p>
  </section>

  <section id="mantle" class="layer-section">
    <h1>Mantle</h1>
    <p>The mantle lies below the crust, consisting of semi-solid rock that flows slowly over time. It is responsible for tectonic movements and volcanic activity.</p>
    <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The mantle makes up about 84% of Earth’s volume and can reach temperatures of up to 4000°C.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="outer-core" class="layer-section">
    <h1>Outer Core</h1>
    <p>The outer core is a layer of molten metal, primarily iron and nickel, creating Earth's magnetic field.</p>
    <p><strong>Interesting Insight:</strong> The outer core’s movement generates Earth's magnetic field, which protects us from harmful solar radiation.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="inner-core" class="layer-section">
    <h1>Inner Core</h1>
    <p>The inner core is a dense, solid metal sphere composed mostly of iron and nickel.</p>
    <p><strong>Did you know?</strong> Despite its extreme heat, the inner core remains solid due to immense pressure.</p>

    <h1>Why I Chose Physical Geology</h1>
    <p>My Physical Geology course (Geography 2065), which gave me an understanding of the internal structure of the Earth, exposed me to this subject. I have always found the dynamics that form our planet and the roles that each layer plays in geological processes like plate tectonics, earthquakes, and volcanism to be fascinating, which is why I chose this study. The information I learned in this course increased my understanding of the complexity of the Earth and sparked my interest in learning more about how different layers interact and affect our day-to-day existence.</p>
